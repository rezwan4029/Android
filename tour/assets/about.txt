The developers of Banglar Pothe are final year students from Computer Science and Engineering department of Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. 
Banglar Pothe is the result of hardship by four of us which was actually developed as a final year project in our university.
As stated earlier, this travelling guide was developed as a project for final year. Instead of creating a dummy project, we decided to make a site full of dynamic information. We tried to be very accurate about the description and all other information provided for the places. If anyone has anything to add or correct please mail us about that providing correct information.
