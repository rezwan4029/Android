Birishiri is a rural locality lying at the foots of Garo Hills and ran through by a beautiful river named Someshwari. It's in Netrokona, a district to the north of Dhaka and bordering with India. The full length (mailing) address would be Birishiri, Durgapur, Netrokona, Bangladesh. Yep, your friends in Birishiri will receive the postcards if you send them to an address that ends like that A trek along the banks of Shomeshwari in early morning or at afternoon should make most of the travelers happy, but you should see/do the followings as well.
Cross the river once you are satisfied with your trek along the bank. You'll have to get on one of the local ferry boats. The fair is 15tk.
There is a hill of white china clay, you might like to have a look/climb that. Ask local people about directions. They know that hill as "Cheena matir pahar". You can either walk through the village or ride a riksha to reach that hill.
If your trek was early in the morning, you will probably be seeing the china clay hill at around mid day and will be back to the point where you crossed river at around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon. You might like to take a dip in the river if you are adventurous. I did that and liked it.
After doing all this, you'll be back at the place where you're staying at around or just after sunset. Hope you had a nice day.
